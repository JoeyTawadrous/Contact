Contact will help you to Have Better Relationships.


# About

There are always people in all of our lives that we would like to keep in touch with.. every couple weeks or every couple months. Whether it's an old friend that moved away, a new yoga buddy, an investor for your project, an extended family member or an amazing customer.

Contact makes it easy for you to improve and maintain these relationships by reminding you when it's time to reach out to them and what the two of you talked about the last time.

In our world today we're more connected than ever. We spend countless hours online, sometimes losing ourselves in the noise of the future, that we forget about the present and the people in our lives.


# Contact Will Help You

- Be a better friend, mentor, sibling, salesperson, networker.
- Have Better Relationships.
- Never fall out of contact with the people who matter to you. 


# How It Works

Whether it's your family, relatives, colleagues or gym acquaintances, Contact will allow you to create groups of people, schedule reminders, add topics & receive push notifications when you've scheduled to make contact.


Sometimes it's difficult to meet people that you genuinely connect with. Keep in touch with them and build a stronger connection with the people that matter.
